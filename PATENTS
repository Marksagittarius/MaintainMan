Additional Grant of Patent Rights

"Software" means the MaintainMan software distributed by xaxys.

xaxys and MaintianMan contributors ("author") hereby grants to each recipient
of the Software ("you") a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
irrevocable (subject to the termination provision below) license under any
Necessary Claims, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Software.

The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) directly or
indirectly: (i) copy the source code without modification in order to finish
your homework, (ii) distribute, and/or sell copies of the Software in binary
form without notifing the author.

A "Necessary Claim" is a claim of a patent owned by author that is
necessarily infringed by the Software standing alone.
